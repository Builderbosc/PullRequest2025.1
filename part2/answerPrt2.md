# Part 2

1. New Relic, Git and Datadog
2. Git is an industry datandard, meaning most developers are famailiar with it. On top of this, Git is open source and free to use.
3. 
- (Branch) A different version of Git that has different files from the main branch, making it possible for different developers work on different aspects of the project
- (Pull) Obtaining the files of a branch from the cloud onto your computer, creating a local "Clone" of the project
- (Push) Uploading any and every local changes made onto your computer into the cloud.
- (Repository) The Cloud files of the project, which members of the project push and pull their iterations on.
- (Working Copy) The copy of the project that functions localy on workers computers.
- (Merge) The method of combining two seperate branches togther, combining the assets. Often done most near a projects end.
4. Do Not delete assets or make reversion without permision, communicate effectively what has changed with any and every push, communicate on what assets eveoryone is working on.
5. Meld is a tool that can help with emrge conflicts that shows files side by side, making it easier to see whats different between the files and how to fix any merge issues.
6. Git Tells you about any merge conflicts before it allows you to merge both files.
7. Check the files in conflict. If there are features that would be overwritten, copy the code and add it to the merge files, then choose it.
8. Git Revert can revert a project to a previous state of developent. Its most useful when the current version has feauters that boat and/or makes it harder to work in.
9. Git reset discards all private branch commits, unti you return to a specefic commit.
10. Git revert is good at undoing certain changes to the main branch, while Reset is better for private branch.
11. False.
12. True.
13. The combination of development and opertations to develop software quickly. Its useful for planning developent in advance and is faster than more traditional development processes.
14. DevOps Tools:
	- Some tools for the Discovery phase include Google for searching references and Microsoft Teams for communication with the team.
	- Planing tools can include Trello, for showing what tasks need to be done, who is working on them and what has been done.
	- For Building your code abnd game, the larger project enjoys game engines such as Unity and Unreal.
	- A good tool for Source Code Control is Github, which can create branches of code and update several braches.
	- For Operation, Trello is also very handy for activly tracking tasks progress and for monitoring any new issues a dev may have.
	- For Testing, Unity has built in testing tools to make sure that all aspects of the code work properly.
	- Some Tools for Post Feedback could be Itch.io or Steams comments and/or reviews, which can allow users to tell you extacly how they felt about the project.
15. CI/CD Is a development process where the development in worked in two major states, nmaking whanges before the work is finshed, and making changes after. This is effective in games with live updates.
