# Part 3

1. To add Git, go to https://desktop.github.com/download/ and download github desktop on all of the members team, following the instructions of the installer. Make sure that all the members have their own github account. Then, create a repository. Next, copy over the major project files into the git repository. Push the files, and then all all members of the team to the project. Then, on giyhib, add the accounts to the repository as members. Then get all members of the team to pull the project. If the team members are unning into any issues, talk to upper managment and tech support for help.
2. For creating branches in Git, make sure branches focus on only very specific aspects of the project (e.g. have a branch for 3D modeling).
3. 
	1. Create two seperate branches. the "Main" branch that is used for uploading consumer grade builds, and  builds for development. You can and should create serveral development branches for types of the project, such as an art branch and a programming branch.
	2. Develop the game with certain members working on certain branches, such as the artists in the art department, the Ui designers in the Ui department,. 
	3. Assign a group on version conrol and get them to occasionally bring together completed branches together, and the upload it to the main branch. This way, if the programming branch needs assets from the art brach, they can more easily pull the needed assets.
	4. Continue this process util the major aspects and goals of the project are complete. Create a main build branch with all the features needed uploaded, and upload the final build to the desired site. 
	5. To continue this process for long term support of the product, simply re-use this process.
