The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.






I lost the teleportation stone.

I don't have the time to look for it.

I'll have to defeat them all,

otherwise, I can't make it out alive.

My body is exhausted.

I can't use Stealth or Murderous Intent.

But even so,

I cannot give up.

I must...

Survive!

Because I've always been weak,

I understand the sorrow of the weak
better than anyone else.

But still, I desire to climb to the top.

That kid has a nickname,
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

The weakest? Not the strongest?

The weakest.

He was even injured in an E-Rank
dungeon and hospitalized.

He's probably the weakest hunter.

Sung.

It's enough.

Don't push yourself anymore.

That's right, Jinwoo.

It's better to give up now.

It's your own fault.

Why do you always love to take risks?

As an E-rank hunter, you should be content

to have grown this much.

Shouldn't you?

Jinwoo.

The third Jeju Island raid mission.

At that time, I was unable to fight,

so I couldn't participate.

You participated, right?

Yes. My mission was to relay orders
and be on the outer guard.

There were many casualties.

Those who returned alive
have indelible traumas.

Any hunter

would have such experiences.

However, if we cannot overcome the trauma,

what awaits us

is death.

By the way, is this person really me?

'I' seem completely different.

Not only taller, but also stronger.

'I' feel very strong.

But the change is only on the outside.

'I' am still weak inside.

'I' am about to lose my life again.

E-rank hunter Sung Jinwoo.

This is what you are.

Reckless and unaware of your position.

Shut up.

You have a long way to go.

You talked about
your realization to act cool.

That's why you ended up like this.

You are the one who k*lled yourself.

In the end... nothing changed?

Just like that time.

What happened after that?

Eh?

This quest is over?

Is this what
'Luck is also a strength' means?

It seems that you are not to die here.

See you next time.

This is

the Penalty Zone.

I remember now.

I haven't completed my daily quest today.

No matter what,

nice timing.

Thanks to this, I survived.

It wishes me good luck?

It means this quest is hard enough
to wish me good luck.

Or maybe it wants to cheer me on.

Whatever.

Store.

This is the first time
my fatigue level has exceeded 90.

Hmm?

In a critical state,

even potions can't restore HP?

I'll have to let it recover naturally

or automatically when I level up.

It seems I worried for nothing.

See you next time?

Sure.

If I can survive, let's meet again.

If you can't k*ll me,

this pain

will only make me stronger.

I had a strange dream.

Hmm?

Brother is still not back?

Is he working this late?

Maybe he has a girlfriend?

That's impossible.

I told him there'd be
a parent-teacher meeting today.

He should come in time.

It's great that I can recover
when leveling up.

There's over 10 minutes left.

I'll use the time

to prepare my equipment.

Hmm?

Purchase.

Knight k*ller.

Increases damage to
armor-type monsters by 25 percent.

It's expensive but useful.

Next is this one.

The rune stone I obtained
when I k*lled Igris.

This should also be useful.

Ruler's Hand.

A skill that doesn't consume MP?

Seems quite handy.

It can physically manipulate objects
without touching them.

Like that move?

I can't move objects that are too large.

That's probably all the preparations
I can make.

The rest is up to luck.

A few hours apart and your
numbers have increased a lot.

Approaching the Jeju Island
air defense zone.

Understood.

Sorry.

This must be very uncomfortable for you.

No.

I'm fine.

Although I wasn't a hunter yet
during the third Jeju Island raid,

I can understand your feelings.

I'm grateful to hear that.

Mr. Choi.

A faint mana reaction
has been detected at sea.

Please check the screen.

This is...

This Knight k*ller is quite useful.

Much better than fighting with bare hands.

But...

What's with this strange feeling?

I've defeated so many,
yet there's no progress at all.

There's no sign of leveling up.

Moreover,

what is that Mage doing?

He's been chanting spells,
but not launching any att*cks at me.

Only these Knights are attacking.

What are they doing?

The gate.

Is it summoning magic?

These Knights are summoned

as weapons.

So even if I defeat them,
I won't earn any points.

My target should be

the Mages

which means you!

I was right.

The target should be the Mages.

Since I figured this out...

Five left.

Four left.

How long do you plan to hide behind them?

Three to go.

Golems?

You are collecting the Knights' power
to summon a powerful beast.

However, the fewer the Knights,
the easier it is to find you.

The Mage who summoned you disappeared.

So you should

go to hell!

It's over.

What's next?

The more points obtained,

the higher the chance of changing
to a high-ranked job.

The system will analyze
the player's actions in the quest

and assign a corresponding job.

Can't I choose for myself?

Eh? What does this mean?

Shadow Army?

Eh?

Wait a minute, what's this?

This... is my job?

Necromancer?

Hold on...

My intelligence has hardly developed.

How can this be?

The Necromancer is a magical profession

capable of summoning undead beasts
and controlling them in battle.

I am an Assassin-type hunter

with a close-quarters combat style.

My improvements focused on strength,

my skills too.

If I change my job to a Necromancer,
a back-line profession,

all the abilities I've gained
will be useless.

Yes or No?

So I can reject it?

Changing to necromancer

is too risky, and the reward is uncertain.

No.

Hidden class?

Does this mean the profession
has special abilities?

Necromancer.

If only I could experience
its abilities first.

Summoning magic.

That's right.

The summoning magic used by these Mages

resembles the Necromancers' abilities.

And all my battles here

are like a review of past battles.

The sound of "job change"
made me think I had a choice.

But it was all prearranged?

Is the system playing tricks?

But it's quite interesting.

These Mages had no combat ability,

but I do.

No one says Necromancers
can't fight on the front lines.

If the profession is part
of the ability stats,

it will be strengthened
with leveling up like the skills.

And the undead army
may also grow stronger.

This means...

From now on,
it won't be just me leveling up.

Well then.

Please.

Thank you.

It's almost dawn.

Hunter Cui and the others should
be arriving on the island soon.

Hmm.

Sorry for keeping you up so late.

It's nothing.

Now that you've stayed,

are you up for a chat?

Shadow Monarch?

I had a second job change?

Did I get so many points?

Acquired job skills
and ability points +10.

I also received a title.

Since the reward has been delivered,

does that mean this quest is over?

So... I've completed the job change?

I can hear them making sounds like screams

as if expressing their pain.

Shadow Extraction.

A command word.

Arise.

This is amazing.

Exclusive skill 'Shadow Extraction'.

And 'Shadow Storage'?

I can extract MP
and create Shadow Soldiers

and summon or absord them anytime.

So they are the Shadow Soldiers?

Their postmortem interval and strength
will affect the skill's failure rate.

I should take note of that.

Besides Knights, there are also Mages.

They even have their own levels.

If I could extract A-rank
or S-rank shadows

and their abilities stats

are the same as before their death...

Okay.

There is a limit to the number
of soldiers I can keep.

Eleven shadow soldiers,
extraction released.

Sorry for waking you up.

Alright.

Blood-Red Commander Igris.

If I could bring him under my command...

Arise.

What?

Is this the situation mentioned earlier?

Two more times.

Arise.

Damn.

I don't have to explain.

As hunters, without a second awakening,

our abilities will stay
the same in our lifetime.

That's why we practice martial arts
and call upon companions.

Are you waiting for your king to return?

The king who may not return at all.

Commander Igris.

You are a warrior.

Wielding your sword against enemies
must be your inner desire.

Do you want to let your sword
rot in such a desolate place?

If you need someone
to wield your sword for,

fight for me.

Don't guard that empty throne.

Protect me, who stand before you.

Arise.

But,

I too occasionally dream of...

... the awakened that keeps
appearing in this world.

Isn't that obvious?

Igris.

This is your name.

I hope that among them

there will be one who possesses
a power with the brilliance of hope.

Perhaps he is awakening
at this very moment.

Nice to meet you.

Mr. Choi.

What is this?

I don't know either.

As far as I know,
such a thing shouldn't be here.

However,

it appears to be...

They have evolved.
